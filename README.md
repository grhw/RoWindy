# RoWindy
Another Roblox extension/userscript, made by gustwindy
**WARNING: VERY WIP, CURRENTLY IN ALPHA!! EXPECT INSTABILITY AND LACK OF SETTINGS**



## Installation
- Install via stores below, or;
- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/grhw/RoWindy/releases/latest) and add install manually. (There's also a userscript you can use there, but it wont auto-update)

## Features
- Force Join Servers (Which means, even if something like your friend leaving happens, it lets you join anyway.)
- Server Invite Links
- Rejoin Last Server (WIP)
- User Pins + Categories (no limit)
- Optional border colors for categorized people

## Requirements
- until some time in the future, this actually relies on BTRoblox. (specifically on getting server data)

## Build Requirements
- `terser`, `js-beautify` on pip, and of course Python.
- Check `build/`
